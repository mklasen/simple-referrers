### Simple Referrers

A WordPress plugin that reads and saves the page visitors are referred from.

It saves the following data:   
- Referral link
- Target URL
- Date & Time
- Referral domain

The data is visible in Settings -> Simple Referrers. 

Admin pages and users with the manage_options role are excluded.

That's really all it does.
